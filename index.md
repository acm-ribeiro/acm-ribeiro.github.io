### About Me
I am a Phd Student at NOVA School of Science and Technology working towards automating the 
microservice testing process, in a black-box setting, leveraging their API specifications.
I am advised by Professor [Carla Ferreira](http://www-ctp.di.fct.unl.pt/~cf/). My main interests include Software Testing & Verification, specially in a black-box scenario.
